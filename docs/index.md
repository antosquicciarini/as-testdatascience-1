Welcome to the documentation for the **Forest CoverType Classification Project**.

This project performs multiclass classification using the [Forest CoverType dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/31/covertype). It is structured, reproducible, and built with a focus on experimentation and best practices in data science.

### üîç Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training of multiple classifiers
- Dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Balanced evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1, G-Mean, Recall, Specificity
- DevOps-ready structure with Makefile, environment setup, and linting
